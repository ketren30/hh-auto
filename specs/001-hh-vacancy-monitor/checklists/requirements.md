# Specification Quality Checklist: Мониторинг подписок hh.ru и черновики писем

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2026-05-01  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes (2026-05-01)

- Initial review: spec describes capabilities (auth, subscriptions, polling, drafts, editable fields, sound) without naming stacks; hh.ru and «API» framed as official access assumptions.
- FR-006 embeds the user’s letter structure as content rules, not as implementation.
- SC-003 and SC-006 use measurable review/survey thresholds; SC-003 references FR-006 for consistency checks.

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit-clarify` or `/speckit-plan`.
